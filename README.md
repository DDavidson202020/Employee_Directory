# Employee_Directory
## Description
This employee directory application was bulit using React.js. It requires me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events like filtering out employees by first name, sorting by the employees first, last name or by age. All the employees data is pulled from the Random User API provided. The app generates a list of random employees from this API. I created a table to display the random employees and display the following categories (Columns):
* Image
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Age
* City
* State
## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
